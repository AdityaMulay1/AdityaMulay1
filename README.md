👋 Hi, I'm @AdityaMulay1, a third-year college student at MIT ADT University in Pune, India. I have a passion for coding, art, design, technology, and music.

👀 I'm interested in exploring the intersection of technology and creativity, building innovative solutions, and staying updated with the latest developments in the tech world.

🌱 I'm currently honing my skills in advanced Python, database management systems, and learning various other techniques to enhance my programming abilities. I'm also working on several exciting projects, including a mental health chatbot named Aurora that aims to provide support and connect users with therapists, a watch application to measure heart rate and pulse, and an IoT-based environment carbon emission measurement device.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on projects that involve coding, design, and creative problem-solving. If you have ideas or opportunities, let's connect and discuss how we can work together.

📫 How to reach me: Feel free to send me a message here on GitHub or connect with me on LinkedIn ([Aditya Mulay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditya-mulay-93839025a/)). I'm always open to valuable discussions, ideas, and collaboration. Let's make great things happen!
